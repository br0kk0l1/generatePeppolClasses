This is just a small project to generate classes for peppol constants
It crawls "https://test-docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/codelist/", parses out the relevant codes and generates php class files with constants.
It's admittedly way too complicated for what it does, but hey, I'm learning Symfony...

This might get extended to generate entities for a complete peppol implementation, but I might do that by hand, as it's a one off effort...
